My task is to extract the information that survey takers write down on their forms that are then scanned as a pdf. The trouble is the handwriting is not great and the scans are not great. Additionally, we are constrained to solve this problem in databricks in an airgapped environment. We have some foundation models available to us in "available_models.xlsx", and we have virtually all python packages we may need to do this task. Additionally, we cannot git clone into this environment. The files you see here in this directory ("databricks_2") will be available locally in databricks, but the production real pdfs and the foundation models are located in s3 buckets and must be handled accordingly. 

Given this, I need you solve this problem given the constraints I have presented to you. I need you to use "example1.pdf" and "example2.pdf" as your test documents and actually develop a loop where you build a script to process those 2 documents then check against their ground truth labels in "example1_answers.json" and "example2_answers.json". If there are errors, please adjust accordingly (within your constraints), reevaluate your test script and cycle through until you get both documents exactly correct (within your model constraints).

Ultimately, I will run this in a databricks notebook and will probably have 2 cells: utils and run. I don't care how you setup a more normal script to perform the testing against the two examples provided here, but once you have confidence you have solved it (without any cheating and within constraints), then create a utils.py and run.py that I will then copy over to my databricks environment and run over the files in the s3 bucket, writing the results bucket, and pulling from the foundation model zone s3 bucket (all of these variables will be in config.yaml in my production databricks environment).

Last thing to emphasize is to not take shortcuts or cheat and minimize hard coding of things. I need to run this dynamically and be robust to future iterations of scans. That being said, the MVP is a working set of code to analyze these 2 examples and produce the two ground truth labels provided here in the databricks_2 directory.
